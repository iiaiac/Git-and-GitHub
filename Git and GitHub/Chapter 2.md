b.Bookmark frequently visited repositories for quick access.

c. Customize your dashboard by following repositories or people that interest you.

**Conclusion**

The GitHub interface is designed to be user-friendly, but like any new tool, it takes a little time to become fully comfortable with it. Experiment with different features, and soon you'll navigate GitHub with ease.
